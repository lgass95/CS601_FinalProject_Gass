                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p> I am originally from Reading, MA and spent my undergrad years studying in Washington, D.C.
                        After graduating and spending some time working in the non-profit sector, I have returned to the Boston
                        area to continue my studies. My main interests in web development revolve around front-end engineering
                        with HTML and CSS as well as working with databases using languages like SQL. One of my goals is to
                        develop a skillset that will equip me to provide website-building services to small businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p> When I am not studying web development, I spend my time exercising, studying personal training and 
                        nutrition, and exploring my neighborhood on foot. One of my favorite things to do when out and about
                        is discover new restaurants and coffee shops. I enjoy travel and have been to several parts
                        of the United States, as well as to Turkey and England. I hope to one day take separate trips to 
                        Japan and across Europe. 
                    </p>
