                <h2>Hello,</h2>
                <p>My name is Luke Gass and I am a student at Boston University. This website will serve as a biography 
                and portfolio to showcase the skills I learn as I dive in to the world of web development. I hope 
                you will enjoy the content I publish here and come to learn a little about me as I continue to work on it.
                </p>
